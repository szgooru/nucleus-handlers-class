/**
 * This package provides a convenience class which is used to run the DBHandlers
 * against the Database using active jdbc methods of getting connections and
 * running transactions. It provides try - catch handlers to make sure that
 * handlers when run are either committed or rolled back, and the connection is
 * detached from current thread. In case there was an operation marking
 * connection as read only, it needs to be restored back to its value
